00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
A Data Scientist is a person who uses data to solve problems. uncover patterns and gain

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
insight.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.200
They often work in businesses and organizations which gather and curate large data sets.

4
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.520
A data scientist may leverage knowledge from statistics. computer programming. databases.

5
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.360
machine learning and mathematical modeling to achieve their goals.

6
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.800
A day in the life of a data scientist.

7
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.400
First. the data scientist needs to understand the business or organizational issues.

8
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.120
Then they look for data.

9
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.720
They may need to set up an experiment to acquire the data or the data may already exist somewhere

10
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.720
in.

11
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.520
If an experiment is required. it is important to write down the hypothesis before proceeding.

12
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.800
Once the data is gathered. it is checked and cleaned.

13
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.600
Then. the right tools for modeling are chosen.

14
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.600
For example. R. Python or another software package.

15
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.480
The data and results are then analyzed using visualization tools.

16
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.360
The data scientist is looking for important insights and trends and checking their hypothesis.

17
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.040
Statistical tests are used to check the results robust and valid.

18
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.880
The learnings. results and insights are communicated to the stakeholders. usually with recommendations.

19
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.440
For example. a data scientist working for a transport company might identify particular

20
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.000
routes that are inefficient and recommend solutions to them more efficient.

21
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.520
With the advent of the data age. we can all now. with the help of data scientist. give

22
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.320
better insights and make better data driven decisions.
